# Baseline-Beacon
Baseline Beacon is a command-line tool that instantly audits web projects against the official Baseline standard, providing teams with clear, actionable insights into their adoption of modern, production-ready web features.

🎯 The Problem It Solves
Developers and engineering teams waste countless hours manually checking browser compatibility across multiple sources (MDN, caniuse, blog posts). There's no quick way to answer strategic questions like:

"What percentage of our codebase uses universally-supported features?"

"Which modern features are we using that might be tech debt?"

"How does our project compare to industry stability standards?"

💡 The Solution
Baseline Beacon scans your entire codebase in seconds and generates a comprehensive report that:

Categorizes every web feature as Baseline, Newly Available, or Not Widely Supported

Provides instant visibility into your project's web platform health

Highlights specific features that need polyfills or alternative approaches

Generates beautiful terminal and HTML reports with actionable recommendations

🛠️ How It Works
Scan: Rapidly analyzes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript files

Match: Cross-references found features against the official web-features npm package

Report: Generates color-coded terminal output and an interactive web dashboard

Advise: Provides direct links to MDN documentation and migration guidance
